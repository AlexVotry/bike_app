# Zen Bike app
---

This is an app that uses the Strava API.  It lists the bikes mileage and then itemizes the parts on the bike.  
You can edit the components, and the interval between replacement. 
My goal is to link it to Amazon so you can click on your component when you need a new one, 
and be able to purchase a new one without having to search for it.

I used Angular with Bootstrap on the front end.  I did some animation with CSS.  
The back end is Node, Express and Postgres with Knex.
